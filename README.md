## Firebase Setup & Deployment

This project includes Firebase Firestore and Storage security rules that need to be deployed to your Firebase project.

### Files

- `firestore.rules` - Security rules for Firestore database
- `storage.rules` - Security rules for Firebase Storage

### Deployment

To deploy these rules to your Firebase project:

1. Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

4. Deploy the rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
   ```

### Important Notes

- Make sure to test these rules in a development environment first
- The rules include role-based access control for admin, teacher, and parent users
- Users must be authenticated to access any data
- Role information should be stored in the user's document in the `users` collection

### Comment System Features

The updated Firestore rules now include comprehensive support for:

- **Assignment Comments**: Users can read all comments, create comments (linked to their user ID), and edit/delete their own comments
- **Announcement Comments**: Same permissions as assignment comments
- **Role-based Moderation**: Teachers and admins can delete any comment for moderation purposes
- **Security**: All comment operations require authentication and proper user validation

### Date Handling

The application now properly handles different date formats:

- **Firestore Timestamps**: Automatically converted using `.toDate()`
- **Date Objects**: Handled directly
- **String Dates**: Parsed with fallback error handling
- **Invalid Dates**: Display friendly error messages instead of "Invalid Date"
